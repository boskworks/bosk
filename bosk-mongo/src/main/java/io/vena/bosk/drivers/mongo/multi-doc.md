## Design principles

### _Sequoia_ and _Pando_ formats

The existing format is called _Sequoia_, and stores the entire state tree in one big document.
Aside from `refurbish`, it doesn't need multi-document transactions.

The multi-document format is called _Pando_, and stores the state tree using one "root" document,
plus a number of separate documents corresponding to nodes that are entries in particular
`Catalog` or `SideTable` nodes configured to be stored separately.

### Manifest is the system of record for layout

A `MongoDriver` will accept a configuration describing the desired database layout.
However, if the database already exists, this is ignored, and the layout from the `manifest` document is used instead.
(In this way, the layout acts like the `initialState`.)

Any change to the `manifest` document probably triggers the bosk to be reloaded
the same way as for `initialState`.

### Scattering and gathering are done by mutating Bson objects

A single bosk update can correspond to multiple database writes,
and conversely, multiple change events can correspond to a single bosk update.
We refer to these as "scattering" and "gathering", respectively.

Scattering is done in these steps:
1. Serialize the bosk state into Bson as usual
2. Mutate the Bson to separate it into multiple Bsons based on the database layout
3. Write the objects in bottom-up order

Gathering is done in these steps:
1. Receive all the change events and buffer them, bottom-up, ending with the top Bson object
2. Mutate the top object to include all the other objects
3. Deserialize the Bson into bosk state as usual

### Limitations

There are some decisions we can make initially that will simplify the implementation.
We might find ways to overcome these limitations in the future.

#### Deleted nodes can be left behind

Suppose a Catalog is configured to use a separate collection, and it contains objects `A` and `B`.
Then an update arrives to replace that with `A` and `C`.
The driver is allowed to leave the `B` document intact.

Dangling documents can be cleared via `refurbish()` if desired.

An explicit `submitDeletion` shouldn't leave the main document behind,
but is allowed to, if it finds some other way to communicate the deletion via change streams.

## Database contents

A Pando-formatted database has a single collection called `boskCollection`, just as for Sequoia.

#### Document `manifest`

Fields:
- `version`: a "major version" integer that is incremented whenever there are breaking changes to
the conventions for the manifest document itself
- Variants: only one of the following fields is permitted:
- `sequoia`: an empty document signifying that the database contents are stored in accordance with the Sequoia format
- `pando`: a document containing a `separateCollections` field which describes how the state tree is to be carved up into documents

#### Document `|`

This is the root document.

Fields:

- `_id`: always `|`
- `state`: the bosk state
- Any separate collections (Catalogs or SideTables) map IDs to the value `true` (rather than containing the actual tree node)
- `revision`: the revision number for the entire collection; used to implement flush

#### Sub-part documents

- `_id`: a pipe-delimited BSON path to the location of this document's state within the overall BSON structure
- `state`: the state of the particular node represented by this document

Sub-parts may also have a `revision` field, which is currently ignored.

Often, the BSON path for a particular state tree node looks like its bosk path with slashes replaced by pipe characters.
They will differ for nodes under `SideTable` nodes,
because the BSON representation for those nodes adds an additional field `valuesById`.
