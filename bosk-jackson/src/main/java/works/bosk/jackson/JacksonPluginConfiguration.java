		 *
		 * <ul>
		 *     <li>
		 *         The object also has fields "{@code -first}" and "{@code -last}" pointing

		 * <ul>
		 *     <li>
		 *         Lookup an entry given its ID
		 *     </li>
		 *     <li>

		 *     <li>
		 *         Delete an entry.
		 *     </li>
		 * </ul>
		 *
		 * It also supports linear time walking of the entries in both forward and reverse order.
