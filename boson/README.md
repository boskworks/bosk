## boson

This is the subproject for the published `boson` JSON processing library.
It is not a part of the bosk framework per se, and can be used separately.

We're not particular about how you pronounce the name.
It's the name of a subatomic particle, so you can pronounce it like that,
but also people like to pronounce JSON like "jace on",
so if you want to rhyme it with that, that's fine too.
It comes from a portmanteau of "bosk" and "json".

 **This is a work in progress. It's not suitable for production use yet.**
The JSON validation is spotty at best.
The level of testing is not up to the standards of the rest of the bosk framework.
