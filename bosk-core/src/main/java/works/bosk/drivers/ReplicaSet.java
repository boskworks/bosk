/**
 * A pool of bosks arranged such that submitting an update to any of them submits to all of them.
 * New bosks can be added any time by initializing them with {@link #driverFactory()} in their driver stack.
 * <p>
 * Note that this isn't used for true distributed replica sets with one bosk in each JVM process,
 * but rather for constructing a local replica set within a single JVM process.
 * <p>
 * The primary way to use this class is to instantiate a {@code new ReplicaSet()},
 * then construct any number of bosks using {@link #driverFactory()}.
 * All the resulting bosks will be in the replica set, and more can be added dynamically.
 * <p>
 * There are also some factory methods that simplify some special use cases.
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         Use {@link #mirroringTo} to mirror changes from a primary bosk to some number
 *         of secondary ones.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Use {@link #redirectingTo} just to get a driver that can accept references to the wrong bosk.
 *     </li>

	 * been initialized, because it's impossible to alter those bosks' drivers.)

	 * It may seem counterintuitive that mirrors receive updates before the "main" bosk,
	 * but experience shows that the alternative is even more confusing.
	 * This way, placing {@code mirroringTo} in a {@link DriverStack} causes the mirroring
	 * to occur at that location in the stack, which is easy to understand.
