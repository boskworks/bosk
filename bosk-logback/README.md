## bosk-logback

This is the subproject for the published `bosk-logback` library,
containing extra support for the Logback implementation of SLF4J.
In particular, it allows unit tests to adjust log levels
to eliminate expected log messages from the test output;
this makes it easier to notice important log messages.
