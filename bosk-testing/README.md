This is the subproject for the published `bosk-testing` library for
testing user-created bosk components such as drivers.
It includes a number of utility drivers,
like [`JitterDriver`](src/main/java/works/bosk/drivers/JitterDriver.java)
and [`AsyncDriver`](src/main/java/works/bosk/drivers/AsyncDriver.java),
as well as [`DriverConformanceTest`](src/main/java/works/bosk/drivers/DriverConformanceTest.java)
(and [`SharedDriverConformanceTest`](src/main/java/works/bosk/drivers/SharedDriverConformanceTest.java)).
